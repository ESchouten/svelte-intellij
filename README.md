<h2>Support</h2>

This project is run by one person. Please leave a star and spread the word.

<h2>Contributing</h2>

Contributions are very much welcome! 

IntelliJ Platform runs on JVM, so this can seem like a huge limitation, but don't worry. Kotlin feels a lot like TypeScript. Bigger issue is scarce documentation for their API.

<h2>Building and running the plugin</h2>

You'll need IntelliJ IDEA. Community edition is free and sufficient, you can also use Ultimate edition if you have one. 

Clone the repository and run `./gradlew :runIde` (There are also other intermediate tasks). 

IntelliJ Ultimate will download in a bit and you'll be prompted with license dialog - choose evaluation mode. After 30 days delete `build/idea-sandbox` and start again.

Ready to share `.zip` archive can be found in `build/distributions` after running `./gradlew :buildPlugin`.

<h2>Running tests</h2>

Tests can be run with `./gradlew :test` command or even better or by using run action in IntelliJ IDEA. 

<h2>Writing Tests</h2>

Some of the tests in IntelliJ Platform (notably lexer and parser ones) are similar to Jest snapshots.

You need to create a `.svelte` file in `scr/test/resources` directory and add function composed of the word `test` and file name to appropriate class.
Then run the test. File with expected results will be created and you need to commit it. When updating test simply delete expected file and rerun test.

Lexer tests use `.tokens.txt` extensions, while Parser tests use `.txt`.
